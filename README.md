     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->



---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does: Search the listings data for items matching a description, and optionally a size and a price ceiling.** 
- **Inputs: description: str, size: str, max_price: float** <!-- name and type each: `max_price` (float), not "a price" -->
- **Returns: A list of listing dicts, each with id, title, description, category, style_tags (list), size,        condition, price (float), colors (list), brand (str or None), platform**
- **When it has nothing: If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session and stop. Otherwise, take the first result and go to suggest_outfit.**

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does: Given a thrifted item and the user's wardrobe, suggest one or two outfits.**
- **Inputs:new_item: dict, wardrobe: dict**
- **Returns: A non-empty string with outfit suggestion.**
- **When it has nothing: With an empty wardrobe, return general styling advice rather than raising or returning ""**

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does: Write a short caption someone would actually post about the find.**
- **Inputs:outfit: str, new_item: dict**
- **Returns: A non-empty string with A two-to-four sentence caption.**
- **When it has nothing: If `outfit` is empty or whitespace, return a descriptive message rather than raising**

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->

**Branch rule:**

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** <!-- regex, string splitting, or asking the model — say which -->

**What moves through the session:** <!-- which fields, in what order -->

---

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask 'vintage graphic tee under $30'
The planning loop isn't built yet — see the TODO in agent.py.
```

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```
$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print(search_listings('graphic tee', max_price=30))"

*   **Shoes:** Black combat boots (`w_008`) — *Cuff the hems of the 501s slightly to let the boots stand out.*
*   **Accessories:** Black crossbody bag (`w_010`)
```

```
python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; from utils.data_loader import load_listings; print(create_fit_card('jeans and white sneakers', load_listings()[0]))"

You can never go wrong with a classic pair of vintage Levi's 501 jeans in the absolute best medium wash. Throw them on with some fresh white sneakers for that effortlessly cool, laid-back streetwear vibe. Grab this timeless staple right now on depop for just $38.00 before someone else snatches them up!

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for: I asked ChatGPT to help me implement the three tools in tools.py based on the provided specifications: search_listings, suggest_outfit, and create_fit_card.*
- *What came back: ChatGPT suggested an implementation for search_listings that filters listings by size and maximum price, then ranks the remaining listings using keyword overlap. It also helped implement the two model-based tools for generating outfit suggestions and fit cards.*
- *What I changed: I tested each tool separately instead of assuming the generated code worked. During testing, I found that the model-based tools failed because google.genai was not available in my Python environment. I set up the project environment and dependencies before continuing. I also checked the search results manually to understand how keyword matching could return loosely related items.*

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for: I gave ChatGPT the starter code and instructions for agent.py and asked how to implement Milestone 5’s planning loop and session state.*
- *What came back: ChatGPT suggested storing each tool’s result in the session and reading it back before calling the next tool. It also suggested a branch that stops the agent when search_listings returns an empty list.*
- *What I changed: I tested both paths with python agent.py. The matching query successfully went through search, outfit generation, and fit-card generation. The impossible query stopped after the search and left session["fit_card"] as None. I used these test results to verify that the branch and session-state behavior matched the project requirements.*


## Planning Loop

**Location:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**Branch rule:** After calling `search_listings`, if no matching listings are
returned, the agent stops and tells the user to change the description, size,
or maximum price. Otherwise, it selects the first result, stores it in the
session, generates an outfit suggestion, and then creates a fit card.

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 2.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 3.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 4.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 5.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| #   | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
| --- | --------- | ------ | ------- | ------------- |
| 1   |           |        |         |               |
| 2   |           |        |         |               |
| 3   |           |        |         |               |
| 4   |           |        |         |               |
| 5   |           |        |         |               |

**Diagnoses**



---

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 2.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 3.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 4.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 5.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
